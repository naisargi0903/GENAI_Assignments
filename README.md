- Implement a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) for clustering data points.
- Alternatively, build a simple text generator using Markov Chains.

### 2. **Prompt Engineering Approaches**
- Implement and analyze different prompt engineering methods:
  - **Interview Approach**
  - **Chain of Thought (CoT)**
  - **Tree of Thoughts (ToT)**
- Compare Zero-Shot and Few-Shot prompting and evaluate their effectiveness in different tasks.

### 3. **Fine-Tune GPT or GPT-2 for Creative Story Generation**
- Fine-tune an existing GPT model to generate creative and engaging stories.
- Train on a dataset of literary text to improve coherence and creativity.

### 4. **Simple Question-Answering Chatbot**
- Develop a chatbot using a pre-trained language model such as BERT, T5, or GPT-3.
- Implement context-aware responses based on a given dataset.

### 5. **Stable Diffusion for Creative Artwork**
- Generate artwork using the Stable Diffusion model.
- Modify and fine-tune a pre-trained diffusion model for a custom dataset.

### 6. **Text-to-Image Generation Pipeline**
- Utilize a pre-trained model like DALL-E to generate images from text prompts.
- Experiment with various prompt modifications for better results.

### 7. **Basic Multimodal System for Image Captioning**
- Implement an image captioning model using CLIP.
- Generate descriptive captions based on image input.

### 8. **Text-to-Speech Model**
- Develop a text-to-speech model using Tacotron or WaveNet.
- Train on a dataset of speech samples for improved voice synthesis.

### 9. **AI-Based Video Animation Generator**
- Utilize an AI tool to generate simple animations from text or images.
- Explore motion synthesis using AI-based techniques.

### 10. **Transformer-Based Text-to-Image Model**
- Use a Transformer-based text-to-image model to explore its multimodal capabilities.
- Experiment with different architectures like DALL-E and Stable Diffusion.
